Project 00 About me site

Overview

In this project, we were instructed to build an "About me" website. This will serve as a portfolio page as we begin
to look for jobs in the future. It will have a brief description of ourselves, showcase projects that we have worked on,
give examples of testimonials, and have a contact form. How we build our page will show what we've learned in class and how we've applied these techniques.

****Technologies used:
There are a few different bits of code I have googled and applied to my site:

-First one being a bootstrap carousel for my projects section. It scrolls from left to right showing a screenshot of the project page. If you click on it it will take you to that projects page.

-Next bit of tech I used is a "back to top" scroll button feature which I found in a codepen (https://codepen.io/desirecode/pen/MJPJqV).

-Another thing I found is an animated hamburger menu.(https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_menu_icon_js).

-Lastly I found this slide out menu (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sidenav.asp).

****Process/Approach:
The way I approached building my "about me" webpage was a step by step process. I first wrote out a pseudocode which served as a checklist. I wrote out which major sections needed to be built (about, projects, testimonials, and contact). First I set up my html with all the sections with placeholders. Then I gave it some basic styling so I could at least see how the page is progressing. Once I had those I began filling in content for each section. A lot of tweeks were made along the way. I tried to keep 3 colors at most for my webpage. For the background I googled "AH logo blue" (my initials). I found a vector that fit my theme well. I downloaded the sample vector and I am considering buying it.

****Unsolved Problems:
I was about to work out most of the problems I encountered. One of the problems I encountered was trying to figure out how to intergrate a carousel for my projects section. The carousel I settled on was probably the 3rd or 4th carousel I found. Previous carousels would not fit on the page correctly, or just not work at all. Second issue I had was getting the hamburger button to work. Like the carousel, I went through a few different buttons. Some buttons would not animate, some would not function correctly. Third issue I ran into was the slide out menu for when my page is viewed in a small resolution. Getting this to work with my hamburger menu button was a challenege. I went through many different styles that would work with the ham button and have it fit the theme of my page. Lastly, figuring out how i wanted to display the testimonials. At first I was thinking of doing a carousel like the projects section, but once I did that, the indicators of the testimonials would control the projects carousel. So I decided to keep it simple and add blockquote styling instead.

****Biggest Wins:
I feel my biggest win is the page I created overall! I was able to overcome all the small challenges I encountered and have everything intergrate with eachother. I learned a lot and I'm very proud that I made this webpage from scratch. Moving forward, I feel more confident working on webpages.
